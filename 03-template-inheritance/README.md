# 03 Using Templates

Don't worry! We get you covered! So, you don't need to put every static page code ( html, css, js ) inside the python code. You can just use [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templates and mix it with our already defined page.

Let's inject some new pages using a [Initalizr HTML boilerplate](http://www.initializr.com/). First, download a template. Then copy all html pages inside the /templates/ folder and just put everything else inside the /static/ folder. Also make sure to put all address pointing to the static folder.
