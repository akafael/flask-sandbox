# 1 Hello World

This is a bare bones example of flask application.

## Execution

To start the server just type
```
python hello.py
```

Then open it at <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> . Or try our custom URL page with <http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/yourName>.

Once it is running, any modification in the file /hello.py/ will trigger an page auto page reload at server.
